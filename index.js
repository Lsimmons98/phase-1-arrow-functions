const divide = (x = 2000) => x / 100
const square = x => x * x;
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// For the divide function I originally had const divide = 2000/100. It wasn't passing the test "1) divide divides 2000 by 100." Not sure why it wouldn't pass but what I put in was the only way I could get it to work.
